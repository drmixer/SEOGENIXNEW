              CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:
              1. ONLY provide REAL competitors that actually exist with ACCURATE website URLs
              2. Competitors MUST be in the SAME industry and business type as the target website
              3. DO NOT make up fictional companies or URLs
              4. Ensure all URLs are valid and correctly formatted
              5. Provide SPECIFIC reasons why each company is a competitor
              6. Include DETAILED content overlap analysis based on topics and keywords
              7. Focus on DIRECT competitors first, then indirect competitors

              Discover and analyze competitors across these categories:

              1. DIRECT COMPETITORS - Companies offering very similar products/services to the same target market
              2. INDIRECT COMPETITORS - Companies solving the same customer problem with different approaches
              3. INDUSTRY LEADERS - Major established players in the industry that set market standards
              4. EMERGING PLAYERS - Newer companies or startups that could become significant competitors

              For each competitor, provide:
              - Company name and ACCURATE website URL (must be real and exist)
              - Competitor type (direct/indirect/industry_leader/emerging)
              - Relevance score (1-100) based on how directly they compete
              - Detailed reason why they're a competitor with SPECIFIC product/service overlap
              - Market position analysis with SPECIFIC details
              - 3-5 key strengths with SPECIFIC examples
              - 2-3 key differentiators with SPECIFIC details
              - Content overlap analysis (topics and keywords that overlap with the user's site)
              - Social media profiles if available (real profiles only)

              Focus on discovering competitors the user might not already know about. Avoid suggesting the existing competitors they've already listed.

              ${analysisDepth === 'comprehensive' ? `
              For comprehensive analysis, also include:
              - International competitors
              - Adjacent market players
              - Platform/marketplace competitors
              - Technology stack competitors
              ` : ''}

              Format each competitor as:
              COMPETITOR: [Company Name]
              URL: [Website URL - MUST BE REAL AND ACCURATE]
              TYPE: [direct/indirect/industry_leader/emerging]
              RELEVANCE: [1-100 score]
              REASON: [Specific reason with product/service overlap details]
              MARKET_POSITION: [Specific market position details]

              SOCIAL_PROFILES: [Real profile URLs separated by commas]
